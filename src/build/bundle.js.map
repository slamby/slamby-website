In other words, if a transition is\n     * defined that\n     * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n     * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n     *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n     *   // animation has fully completed itself\n     *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n     *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n     *\n     *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n     *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n     *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n     *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n     *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n     *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n     *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *     animate(500)\n     *   ]),\n     *\n     *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n     *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n     * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n     *\n     * ```html\n     * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n     * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * #### The final `animate` call\n     *\n     * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n     * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n     * animation\n     * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n     * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n     * applied state to be presented correctly.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n     * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n     * transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *   animate(500)\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n     *\n     * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n     * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n     * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * transition(\":enter\", [\n     *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n     * ])\n     * transition(\":leave\", [\n     *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n     *\n     * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n     */\n    function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n        var animationData = Array.isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) : steps;\n        return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n    }\n    /**\n     * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n     * animation\n     * DSL language.

a template once per item from an iterable. The context for\n     * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n     * to the current item from the iterable.\n     *\n     * ### Local Variables\n     *\n     * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n     *\n     * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n     * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n     *   iteration.\n     * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n     *   iteration.\n     * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n     * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n     *\n     * ### Change Propagation\n     *\n     * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n     *\n     * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n     * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n     * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n     * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n     *\n     * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n     * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n     * controls\n     * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n     * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n     * as user input.\n     *\n     * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n     * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n     * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n     * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n     * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n     * be avoided if possible.\n     *\n     * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n     * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n     * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n     *\n     * ### Syntax\n     *\n     * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     *\n     * With `<template>` element:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n     *   <li>...</li>\n     * </template>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n     * example.\n     *\n     * @stable\n     */\n    var NgFor = (function () {\n        function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n            this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n            this._template = _template;\n            this._differs = _differs;\n            this._cdr = _cdr;\n            this._differ = null;\n        }\n        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n            set: function (value) {\n                if (value) {\n                    this._template = value;\n                }\n            },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n                // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n                var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n                if (!this._differ && value) {\n                    try {\n                        this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                    }\n                    catch (e) {\n                        throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

   * [{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]\n     * ```\n     *\n     * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * @description\n     *\n     * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.\n     *\n     * Whe the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">link to user component</a>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path\n     * segments, followed by the params for each segment.\n     *\n     * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n     * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n     *\n     * Multiple static segments can be merged into one (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details:\n     true}]`).\n     *\n     * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:\n     * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the\n     app.\n     * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will\n     * instead look in the children of the current activated route.\n     * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.\n     *\n     * You can set query params and fragment as follows:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" fragment=\"education\">link to user\n     component</a>\n     * ```\n     * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.\n     *\n     * You can also tell the directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>link to user\n     component</a>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.\n     *\n     * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n     *\n     * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` will generate the link\n     * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n     *\n     * @selector ':not(a)[routerLink]'\n     * @ngModule

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n    most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n    For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n    can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n    The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n    discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n    Shimmed features:\n\n    * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n    element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n    reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n    document level stylesheet.\n    For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n      :host {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n      .foo {\n        background: red;\n      }\n\n    * encapsulation: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n    dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n    this feature.\n\n    By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n    as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n    of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n    div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n    x-foo div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n\n    Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n    selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n    simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n    in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n    Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n    For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n      div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n      div[x-foo] {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n    selector added to them manually.\n\n    * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n    shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n    inside a shadowRoot.\n\n    This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n    were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n    every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n    (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n    As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n    specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n    * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n    to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n    of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n    extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n    via descendent selectors.

The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined\n   * using `element_inheritance|properties` syntax.\n   *\n   * ## Element Inheritance\n   *\n   * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.\n   * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list\n   * has identical properties.\n   *\n   * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n   * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n   *\n   * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `[Element]` element, the super element of all\n   * elements.\n   *\n   * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n   *\n   * ## Properties\n   *\n   * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n   * by a special character designating its type:\n   *\n   * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n   * - `*`: property represents an event.\n   * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n   * - `#`: property is a number.\n   * - `%`: property is an object.\n   *\n   * ## Query\n   *\n   * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n   * if a given property exist on a given element.\n   *\n   * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n   * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n   *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n   */\n  // =================================================================================================\n  // =================================================================================================\n  // =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n  // =================================================================================================\n  // =================================================================================================\n  //\n  //                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n  //\n  // Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n  // dom_security_schema.ts.

By\\n        contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your\\n        freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it\\n        remains free software for all its users.</p>\\n\\n        <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\n        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\n        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\n        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\n        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\n        free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\\n        with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\\n        you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\\n        and/or modify the software.</p>\\n\\n        <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\\n        improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\\n        receive widespread use, become available for other developers to\\n        incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\\n        encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\\n        software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\\n        The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\\n        letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\\n        source code to the public.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\\n        ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\\n        to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\\n        provide the source code of the modified version running there to the\\n        users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\\n        a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\\n        code of the modified version.</p>\\n\\n        <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\\n        published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\\n        a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\\n        released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\\n        this license.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\n        modification follow.</p>\\n\\n        <h2><a name=\\\"terms\\\"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>\\n\\n        <h3><a name=\\\"section0\\\"></a>0.

Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and\\n        &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p>\\n\\n        <p>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\\n        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\\n        exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the\\n        earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>\\n\\n        <p>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based\\n        on the Program.</p>\\n\\n        <p>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without\\n        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\\n        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\\n        computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\\n        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\\n        public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>\\n\\n        <p>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\\n        parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\\n        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>\\n\\n        <p>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;\\n        to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\\n        feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\\n        tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\\n        extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\\n        work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\\n        the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\\n        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>\\n\\n        <h3><a name=\\\"section1\\\"></a>1. Source Code.</h3>\\n\\n        <p>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work\\n        for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source\\n        form of a work.</p>\\n\\n        <p>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official\\n        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\\n        interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\\n        is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other\\n        than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\\n        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\\n        Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\\n        Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\\n        implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\\n        &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component\\n        (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\\n        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\\n        produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all\\n        the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\\n        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\\n        control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\\n        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\\n        programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\\n        which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\\n        includes interface definition files associated with source files for\\n        the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\\n        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\\n        such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\\n        subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\\n        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\\n        Source.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\\n        same work.</p>\\n\\n        <h3><a name=\\\"section2\\\"></a>2.

You are not responsible\\n        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>\\n\\n        <p>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an\\n        organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\\n        organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\\n        work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\\n        transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\\n        licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\\n        give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\\n        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\\n        the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>\\n\\n        <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\\n        rights granted or affirmed under this License.

This Corresponding Source\\n        shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\\n        of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\\n        following paragraph.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission\\n        to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3\\n        of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to\\n        convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to\\n        apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is\\n        combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public\\n        License.</p>\\n\\n        <h3><a name=\\\"section14\\\"></a>14.

Such new\\n        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ\\n        in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\\n        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero\\n        General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have\\n        the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\\n        numbered version or of any later version published by the Free\\n        Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number\\n        of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version\\n        ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>\\n\\n        <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\\n        versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that\\n        proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\\n        authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different\\n        permissions.

It is safest\\n        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\\n        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\\n        the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>\\n\\n        <pre>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\\n\\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as\\n    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the\\n    License, or (at your option) any later version.\\n\\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
